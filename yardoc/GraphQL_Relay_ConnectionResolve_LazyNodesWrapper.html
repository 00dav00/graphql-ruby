    <p>Class: GraphQL::Relay::ConnectionResolve::LazyNodesWrapper &lt; Struct
This class is part of a private API.
A container for the proper <code class="highlighter-rouge">parent</code> of connection nodes. Without
this wrapper, the lazy object <em>itself</em> is passed into
<code class="highlighter-rouge">build_connection</code> and it becomes the parent, which is wrong. 
We can get away with it because we know that this instrumentation
will be applied last. That means its code after <code class="highlighter-rouge">underlying_resolve</code>
will be <em>last</em> on the way in. And, its code before
<code class="highlighter-rouge">underlying_resolve</code> will be <em>first</em> during lazy resolution.</p>

    <p>Class: GraphQL::UnionType &lt; GraphQL::BaseType
A Union is is a collection of object types which may appear in the
same place. 
The members of a union are declared with <code class="highlighter-rouge">possible_types</code>. 
A union itself has no fields; only its members have fields. So, when
you query, you must use fragment spreads to access fields. 
Examples:</p>
<h1 id="a-union-of-object-types">A union of object types</h1>
<p>MediaUnion = GraphQL::UnionType.define do
name “Media”
description “Media objects which you can enjoy”
possible_types [AudioType, ImageType, VideoType]
end</p>
<h1 id="querying-for-fields-on-union-members">Querying for fields on union members</h1>
<p>{
searchMedia(name: “Jens Lekman”) {
… on Audio { name, duration }
… on Image { name, height, width }
… on Video { name, length, quality }
}
}

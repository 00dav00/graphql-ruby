    <p>Class: GraphQL::Schema::InstrumentedFieldMap &lt; Object
A two-level map with fields as the last values. The first level is
type names, which point to a second map. The second level is field
names, which point to fields. 
The catch is, the fields in this map <em>may</em> have been modified by
being instrumented. 
Instance methods:
get, get_all, initialize, set</p>

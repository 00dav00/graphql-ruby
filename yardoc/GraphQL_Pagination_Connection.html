    <p>Class: GraphQL::Pagination::Connection &lt; Object
A Connection wraps a list of items and provides cursor-based
pagination over it. 
Connections were introduced by Facebookâ€™s <code class="highlighter-rouge">Relay</code> front-end
framework, but proved to be generally useful for GraphQL APIs. When
in doubt, use connections to serve lists (like Arrays,
ActiveRecord::Relations) via GraphQL. 
Instance methods:
cursor_for, edges, end_cursor, has_next_page, has_previous_page,
initialize, nodes, page_info, start_cursor</p>
